<nav> <h2>Hey there! <br><br>Welcome to Fresh Food.</h2></nav>
<p>   Since it was founded in 2022, <mark>Fresh Cook’s</mark> editorial staff and contributors
 have included recipe developers, practiced home cooks, professional chefs, scientists, 
 historians, journalists, photographers, novelists, and more. Members of our editorial 
 team come from publications like America’s Test Kitchen, Food & Wine, The New York
 Times, and Saveur; most have also worked in the restaurant industry and/or attended 
 culinary school. Across the board, we’re a group of passionate, opinionated food 
 enthusiasts with a drive to dive deep, get things right, and do justice to any topic we take on.</p>

<h1>Why So Serious?</h1>
<p>In our case, serious doesn’t mean exclusive or
 highbrow. Our approach to our work in the kitchen 
 is serious, but the results are for everyone, whether
 you’re a hardcore food nerd making a special-occasion
 feast or a casual, once-a-week cook who’s just looking 
 for your next dinner. Likewise, we take seriously our 
 responsibility to produce only food-related features 
 that are useful, interesting, and accurate, but we’re 
 as open to a tale of wacky experimentation with the American
 Girl doll cookbooks as we are to a reported story on fraud in the seafood industry.</p><br>

<p>Whatever your interests and cooking style, we’ve got a new recipe, technique, or
 thought-provoking perspective on food for you. We believe food can and should be a fun and engaging topic for everyone.</p>

<h1>Our History</h1>
<p>Freah Cook was founded in 2006 by author and journalist Ed Levine, 
who envisioned Serious Eats as a haven for enthusiastic and opinionated 
eaters just like him. Since then, Serious Eats has evolved from its days
fledged food resource best known for its recipe and instructional 
cooking content. You can learn more by checking out Grub Street’s 
Oral History of Serious Eats or learn more about founder Ed Levine’s
 journey in his book Serious Eater: A Food Lover's Perilous Quest for 
 Pizza and Redemption</p><br>
<p>Freash Cook  was acquired by Dotdash Meredith in September, 2020.</p>

<h1>Recipe Development and Testing</h1>
<p>At Serious Eats, our mission is to give home cooks and food lovers
 the skill sets, knowledge, and cultural context to make every meal 
 memorable—with or without a recipe. This means that whether we’re 
 publishing a recipe or writing a story about a specific dish or
 ingredient, we always want to answer the same fundamental questions: </p>
 <h1>Where does it come from? How is it made, and why in that way?</h1>
 <h1>And crucially, who are the best people to answer or otherwise inform those questions?</h1><br>

<p>Each of our recipes is methodically tested and tasted, over and over again,
 by our dedicated recipe developers and crosstesters, all of them skilled 
 culinary professionals. We don’t publish a new Serious Eats recipe until 
 we’re certain it’s the tastiest version out there, and we’re constantly
 updating our old recipes with new techniques and improvements based on further testing and reader suggestions.</p><br>

<h1>Product and Equipment Reviews</h1>
<p>Looking for the best coffee maker or trying to figure 
out which multi-cooker to buy? Our reviews and recommendations 
of food products and kitchen equipment are conducted by culinary
 experts who test each piece of equipment or food item against its
 competitors. If we’re recommending it, you can be sure that it’s
 been thoroughly vetted by knowledgeable writers and editors who
 have actually used and abused the equipment they’re writing about.</p>
